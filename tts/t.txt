Baldur Sanjin: Welcome to "Truth or Fiction," where we dissect the most talked-about conspiracy theories of our time. I'm your host, Joe.

Nova Hogarth: And I'm Nova, ready to dive into the deep end of conspiracy theories.

Baldur Sanjin: Today, we're discussing the resurgence of theories around the infamous Epstein list and its alleged ties to the Clintons.

Nova Hogarth: That's right, Joe. Despite lacking substantial evidence, these theories have gained traction, especially in far-right circles.

Baldur Sanjin: Interestingly, these theories intertwine with older narratives like Pizzagate and QAnon, revolving around elite pedophile rings.

Nova Hogarth: Yes, and it's important to note the role of the internet and social media in spreading these theories, often distorting or misinterpreting actual evidence.

Baldur Sanjin: Absolutely. In our digital age, misinformation spreads fast, making it harder to distinguish fact from fiction.

Nova Hogarth: And while some details of the Epstein case are true, it's crucial to approach these theories critically, understanding the context and seeking reliable sources.

Baldur Sanjin: Right, Nova. It's our responsibility to question and verify before believing or sharing such information.

Baldur Sanjin: Thanks for joining us on "Truth or Fiction." Stay curious and skeptical. Until next time.

Nova Hogarth: Goodbye, everyone. Stay informed!
